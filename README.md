# Quiz
This program allows the user to take a simple quiz based on video game knowledge. THe program is split into two files: index.html and script.js. I did not have time to create the style.css, but with more time I will add style to the interface. Additionally, the highscore aspect is lacking - you can only store your name, but there is not way to see the leaderboard yet as I did not have time create a grid and display each value in the local storage. 

The program begins with a click on the "Go!" button. Classes are called based on the conditions met - either a click, timeout, or reaching the end of the question array. 

Most of the html is written/created in the script.js file as sections must be hidden/written based on click or game events. Ideally, a style.css file would fixed the spacing and add some color to the page. This is a project for when I have more time.
